<p>PHP2Go is a Web Development Framework created back in 2002. Back at that time, only a few frameworks existed that used to provide good foundation code to build Web applications in PHP. From 2002 to 2007, the framework evolved from its original version to the last stable/published release. This version was built in PHP4 and was adjusted in 2004 to be able to run under PHP5.</p>

<p>In 2009, the framework was completely rewritten forking ideas from frameworks like Yii, Zend Framework and Cake. This new development phase took place until 2011, when it finally stopped. This version was built in PHP5, requiring 5.2.0 as its minimum version. It has been tested up to PHP 5.4.x.</p>
