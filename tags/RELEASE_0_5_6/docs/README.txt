	Requirements:
		PHP 4.3.0 or higher (including PHP5)

	Summary:
		PHP2Go is a framework built to help developers and begginer programmers
		to create Web-based Systems. It's and object-oriented, structured and
		hierarchical set of classes and libraries developed using PHP, XML and
		JavaScript.

		The main goal of PHP2Go is to help developers to build systems with code
		reuse, object orientation, separation between logic and presentation code,
		database transparency. All the components of the API have the same purpose:
		to create an object oriented abstraction layer that runs over the powerfull
		PHP API, providing an organized, structured and easier way to create HTML
		documents, HTML forms, database or file data sets, reports, HTML templates
		and much more.

		It's strongly recommended that you read and browse all the classes documentation,
		to know all the features provided by the components. Almost all the most common
		needs of a PHP developer were included in this framework, planned and implemented
		in a way that the task of building the presentation layer of a system can be
		easy, fast and agile. Therefore, soon you're find that, inside the framework,
		there's an easier way to do some common tasks you're used to do in your work with
		PHP. Get to know the framework, class by class, reading the examples and the
		documentation.

		The PHP2Go Web Development Framework is fully compatible with PHP 5.
